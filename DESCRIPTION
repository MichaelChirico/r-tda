Description: Tools for the statistical analysis of persistent homology and for
    density clustering. For that, this package provides an R interface for the
    efficient algorithms of the C++ libraries 'GUDHI' <http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/>, 'Dionysus' <https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/>, and 'PHAT' <https://bitbucket.org/phat-code/phat/>. This package also implements the methods in Fasy et al. (2014) <doi:10.1214/14-AOS1252> and Chazal et al. (2014) <doi:10.1145/2582112.2582128>  for analyzing the statistical significance of persistent homology features.
